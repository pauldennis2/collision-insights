1. Expert guidance - remotely consult with experts from states with greater winter weather; perhaps consider trying to hire some general emergency managers who have such experience (we should be able to find a few people tired of the hassles of snow!)

2. Repurpose existing equipment like dump trucks; attach plows in advance of anticipated snow. Consider investments in modular/multi-purpose vehicles.

3. Investments in brine and spreading supplies of salt/sand in problem areas.

4. Cross-training staff and improving coordination between local counties/cities.

USDOT could also invest in a pool of experts with specific experience in the rare winter weather problem.
