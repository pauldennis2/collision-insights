Night Danger Severity Dashboard Notes

Current issues:
-Dot scaling - some are *extremely* tiny (0-1 accidents)
-Dot size doesn't adjust on zoom (advanced formulas required to fix)
-Limited to the "top 20 highways" selected; expand? To what? Allow user to type in any road?
	-Could get tricky as "I-5" should be distinct, "Main St" not so much
-Ideal behavior would be draw dots smaller, but connect them with lines using average values
-Map goes away when no highways selected
-Lacks linked documentation/how to
-Better color scheme? No obvious ideas
-Extreme zoom on CA-60. Exclude from set? Goldilocks zoom factor (probably v complex)?

Possible extensions:
-Pure county mode (maybe a different sheet, complicated to do on one)
	-Ignoring highways, just show county "darkmap"
